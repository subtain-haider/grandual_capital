<h4>4. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS? </h4>

<p>  

In Short:  If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to certain 

information about you. <br>

Our Services offer you the ability to register and login using your third-party social media account details (like your 

Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from 

your social media provider. The profile Information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, 

but will often include your name, e-mail address, friends list, profile picture as well as other information you choose 

to make public. <br>

We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy policy or that are otherwise 

made clear to you on the Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your 

personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy policy to 

understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on 

their sites and apps.
<br>
</p>

<p>  

In Short:  We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless 

otherwise required by law. <br>

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy,

 unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). 

 No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 2 years past the start of idle 

 period of the user's account. <br>

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it,

 or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we 

 will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

</p>

<br>

<h4>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE? </h4>

<p>  

In Short:  We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures. <br>

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal 

information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. 

Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our 

Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.

</p>
<br>
<h4> 7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h4>

Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate 

the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we

</p>
<br>
<h4>9. DATA BREACH </h4>

<p>  

A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or collection, use, disclosure or disposal of personal 

information. You will be notified about data breaches when Grandeur Capital, LLP believes you are likely to be at risk 

or serious harm. For example, a data breach may be likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or 

physical well-being. In the event that Grandeur Capital, LLP becomes aware of a security breach which has resulted or 

may result in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information Grandeur Capital, LLP will promptly investigate

 the matter and notify the applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless 

 the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

</p>

<br>

<h4>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES </h4>

<p>  

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or 

setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities 

monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. 

As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your 

choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will 

inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.

 to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) 

 we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we 

 shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to
